# Info Dashboard
A Python app to run a local web server that allows gathering data from various APIs and desired information to then display on a visually appealing card-based dashboard. Let me know if you need any help, and I hope to have created an environment for others to build their own cards on

| Cards         | Description |
|:--------------|-------------|
|Calendar       |Creates a Calendar that highlights the current day      |
|Calendar Events|Pulls upcoming events from a given iCal                 |
|Clock          |Gets local time and date                                |
|Countdown      |Counts down days until a given date in its config       |
|Sticky Note    |Provides a spot to leave notes                          |
|Shipping Status|Gets tracking information for the given tracking numbers|
|System Info    |Shows useful system info                                |
|Tasks          |Shows tasks from a provided Monday Board                |
|Weather        |Shows current Weather via OpenWeather API               |

| Extended Cards| Description |
|:--------------|-------------|
|Canvas        |Gets assigned Canvas assignments   |
|Graph         |Graphs given information           |
|News          |Gets news headlines from given api |
|Local Sensors |Gets data from local sensors       |
|Simulation    |Simulates the Game of Life         |
|Steam Friends |Shows Steam friends statuses       |

I plan to change the shipment tracking card so that it does not require tracking numbers to be input, but to use a single webhook instead

Feel free to make your own cards as well! And ask questions
